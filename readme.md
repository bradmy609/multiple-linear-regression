***Yelp Regression***

**Author:** *Bradley J. Myers*

This project is the first in a series of Codecademy machine learning projects. This project works with a large dataset from Yelp to attempt to predict future Yelp ratings. Using Scikit learn's 'Sklearn' linear regression library, the code found in the yelp_regression module computes a model that can successfully predict a business's Yelp rating based on a number of correlated variables. The .ipynb file is a jupyter notebook file, while the .py is a python version of the same file.
